/*
 * REFACTORING NOTES:
 * 
 * Phase 1 Improvements Completed:
 * 1. ✅ Broken down large main dashboard into smaller components
 * 2. ✅ Replaced console.log statements with proper state management 
 * 3. ✅ Implemented global state management using Zustand
 * 4. ✅ Created proper TypeScript interfaces for all data structures
 * 5. ✅ Added loading states and error handling components
 * 6. ✅ Implemented proper navigation state management
 * 7. ✅ Created reusable hooks for data fetching
 * 8. ✅ Added form validation utilities
 * 9. ✅ Optimized component re-renders with React.memo
 * 10. ✅ Created foundation for real API integration
 * 
 * Component Structure:
 * - DashboardContainer: Main container with layout and routing
 * - Sidebar: Navigation component with proper state management
 * - TopBar: Search and user controls
 * - Content Components: Lazy-loaded section-specific components
 * - ErrorBoundary: Error handling for each major section
 * - LoadingSpinner: Reusable loading states
 * 
 * State Management:
 * - Zustand store with proper middleware (devtools, persist, immer)
 * - Typed interfaces for all state
 * - Computed selectors for filtered data
 * - Performance optimizations
 * 
 * API Integration Ready:
 * - ApiClient with retry logic, circuit breaker, error handling
 * - Custom hooks for data fetching (useApi, useApiMutation)
 * - Proper loading and error states
 * 
 * Form Validation:
 * - Zod schemas for all data structures
 * - Reusable validation utilities
 * - React Hook Form integration ready
 * 
 * The original large page.tsx has been completely refactored into
 * a modular, maintainable, and scalable architecture.
