## Testing Setup and Configuration

### Dependencies Installed
- `jest`: Test runner
- `@testing-library/react`: React component testing utilities
- `@testing-library/jest-dom`: Custom Jest matchers
- `@testing-library/user-event`: User interaction simulation
- `@testing-library/dom`: DOM testing utilities
- `jest-environment-jsdom`: JSDOM environment for React testing
- `msw`: Mock Service Worker for API mocking
- `@types/jest`: TypeScript types for Jest
- `undici`: Fetch polyfill for MSW
- `whatwg-fetch`: Additional fetch polyfill

### Configuration Files
- **`jest.config.js`**: Comprehensive Jest configuration with Next.js integration
- **`jest.setup.js`**: Global test setup with mocks and utilities
- **`jest.polyfills.js`**: Browser API polyfills for Node.js environment
- **`package.json`**: Added test scripts (`test`, `test:watch`, `test:coverage`)

### Mock Service Worker Setup
- **`tests/api/mock-handlers.ts`**: Updated with organization API endpoints
- **`tests/api/test-server.ts`**: MSW server configuration
- API handlers for:
  - `GET /api/v1/organization/people` - Fetch people with filtering
  - `POST /api/v1/organization/people` - Create new person with validation
  - Error scenarios and edge cases

## Test Patterns and Best Practices

### Testing Patterns Used
- **AAA Pattern**: Arrange, Act, Assert structure in all tests
- **User-Centric Testing**: Tests focus on user interactions and behaviors
- **Accessibility Testing**: Screen reader queries and keyboard navigation
- **Error Boundary Testing**: Comprehensive error scenario coverage
- **Performance Testing**: Re-render optimization and cleanup verification
- **Integration Testing**: Component interaction and API integration

### Mocking Strategies
- **API Mocking**: MSW for realistic HTTP request/response mocking
- **Hook Mocking**: Custom hooks (useToast, react-hook-form) properly mocked
- **Component Mocking**: Complex dependencies mocked with test-friendly alternatives
- **Browser API Mocking**: IntersectionObserver, ResizeObserver, matchMedia, etc.

### Validation Testing
- **Form Validation**: Zod schema validation testing
- **Business Logic**: Unique email validation, role-based manager filtering
- **Error Handling**: API errors, network failures, validation errors
- **Edge Cases**: Empty states, large datasets, concurrent operations

## Test Execution

### Running Tests
```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run specific test file
npm test AddPersonModal.test.tsx

# Run tests in watch mode
npm test:watch

# Run tests with coverage
npm test:coverage
```

### Test Results
- **Setup Status**: ✅ All dependencies installed and configured
- **Basic Test Execution**: ✅ Tests run successfully
- **Component Mocking**: ✅ React Hook Form and other dependencies properly mocked
- **API Integration**: ✅ MSW handlers created for organization endpoints
