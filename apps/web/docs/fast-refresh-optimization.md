# Fast Refresh Optimization Guide

This document outlines the optimizations made to improve Fast Refresh performance during development.

## Changes Made

### 1. Next.js Configuration Optimizations

- **Filesystem caching**: Enabled for faster rebuilds
- **Better source maps**: Using `eval-cheap-module-source-map` for faster rebuilds
- **Reduced bundle splitting**: Simplified chunk strategy for development
- **SWC optimizations**: Disabled unnecessary file reading
- **Package imports**: Optimized commonly used packages

### 2. Component Optimizations

- **SmartAvatar**: Using proper TypeScript const assertions and memo
- **Loading States**: Centralized loading components for better reusability
- **Dynamic imports**: Optimized with proper loading states

### 3. Development Environment

- **Telemetry disabled**: Reduces overhead
- **Memory optimization**: Increased Node.js memory limit
- **Cache configuration**: Filesystem-based caching for faster builds

## Best Practices for Fast Refresh

### DO:
1. Use `React.memo()` for expensive components
2. Define constants outside components or use `as const`
3. Use proper TypeScript typing
4. Keep components small and focused
5. Use dynamic imports for heavy dependencies

### DON'T:
1. Define objects/arrays inside render methods
2. Use anonymous functions as props
3. Import large libraries in every component
4. Mix business logic with UI components

## Performance Monitoring

The application includes performance monitoring that tracks:
- Component re-render frequency
- Bundle size changes
- Build time optimization
- Memory usage patterns

## Environment Variables

```bash
# Development optimizations
NEXT_TELEMETRY_DISABLED=1
FAST_REFRESH=true
NODE_OPTIONS="--max-old-space-size=4096"
```

## Webpack Optimizations

The Next.js config includes:
- Filesystem caching for faster rebuilds
- Optimized source maps for development
- Reduced chunk splitting in development
- Better file watching for Docker environments

## Component Loading Strategy

Heavy components are lazy-loaded with proper loading states:
- Organization Chart Tab
- ISO Compliance Tab  
- Documents Tab
- Chart libraries (Recharts, D3)
- Virtual list components

This ensures faster initial page loads and better Fast Refresh performance.
